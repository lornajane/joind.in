PHP CodeSniffer standard for joind.in

This is an override of the PEAR code sniffer standard to change some minor docblock requirements
that aren't required for joind.in's codebase:

1. No need to specify PHP version 4 or 5 in the file level doc block.
2. No need to specify a @link, @copyright or @author in file or class level doc blocks.


Usage:
From the src/ directory, run:
    phpcs --standard=../doc/codesniffer/JoindIn path/to/file/or/directory

e.g. to check the api-v2/views directory:
    phpcs --standard=../doc/codesniffer/JoindIn api-v2/views
