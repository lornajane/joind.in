#####################

This is the source code for the Joind.in website - a resource set up to allow
events to get real-time feedback from those attending. It also gives speakers a 
way to claim and track their presentations over time.

There's a few SQL files that are included with the source to help you get things 
up and running. The first four will bring your database to the most current, up-to-date
status and ALL should be run for a new install:
	-----------------------
	-> doc/db/init_db.sql
		Export of the initial data structure, ready for
		import (as exported from MySQL)
		
	-> doc/db/init_data.sql
		This file contains a few handy things for your database's initial setup
		like languages and session categories
		
	-> doc/db/patch*.sql
		Numbered patch files to run in order after running init_db.  All database changes to be
		managed using these, init_db does NOT get updated.  For more information on this approach,
		see http://www.lornajane.net/posts/2010/Simple-Database-Patching-Strategy
		
	-> doc/db/seed_countries.sql
		Some seed data for the countries table (needed for timezone selection)
	-----------------------
	
This last SQL file will give you a jumping off point to see how the system works. It will 
populate your system with some seed data (talks, users, events) so you can see how they all 
relate:
	-----------------------
	-> doc/db/seed.sql
		Some seed data you can load into your (MySQL) database to get the ball rolling
	-----------------------	

Finally, there's some other scripts that come with the source to make things easier to setup.
	- Release of CodeIgniter
	- Sample cron jobs (in /src/scripts)

Installation
#####################
The following are the steps you'll need to correctly install the software:

- Download/clone the current repository and drop it into a 
	web-accessible directory for your server

- Set the document root to the /src directory

- In the /src/system/cache directory, create a web server-writeable 
	directory called "ctokens"
	
- In your src/system/application/config directory:
	> Make a database.php file using the database.php.dist as a guide
	> Make a config.php file using the config.php.dist as a guide
	
- Push the doc/db/init_db.sql file into your database

- Apply any of the other patches in the /db folder

If you'd like some seed data, you can use the seed.sql to load in a few events, 
users and talks. You'll also need to load in the seed_countries.sql file to
get the complete list of countries for the event details.

Extensions
###################
Make sure you have the following extensions installed and configured
- pecl_http
  $ pecl install pecl_http
  
  in php.ini add:
  > linux: extension=http.so
  > windows: extension=http.dll

Tests
#############

There are some tests set up, which use PHPUnit; these can be found in the
src/tests directory.  There is a phing task configured to run them - from the
root directory simply run "phing phpunit" to run the tests.

Note: The API tests actually call the service externally and rely on pecl_http
being installed to run.
